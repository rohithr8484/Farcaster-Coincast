## ðŸš€ How It Works

CoinCast uses the **Farcaster Frames API** and a backend to simulate a real-time portfolio experience.

- Authenticate the user via connected wallet or Sign-In with Ethereum.
- Fetch and display the userâ€™s CoinCast portfolio summary (mock API included).
- Provide a call-to-action for sharing on Farcaster ("Share Portfolio").
- Render a clean, stylized preview image as seen in the CoinCast UI.
